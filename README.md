# Patchwork

Patchwork is an opinionated toolkit to help you quickly build a complete REST API with all CRUD operations, searching, filtering, paging that has an event log to track all database changes with complete fidelity. It will read the schema from your database then automatically generate standard REST API endpoints for all the normal data manipulation operations. All of the exposed data is formatted in JSON and related child records can easily be nested as arrays under the parent record. Support for filtering, sorting, paging, and column selection are all built in and require zero code. The only thing you have to code for is the database connection and the security handlers to tell Patchwork which records a client connection can access.
